### About me

I am a last-year student advised by Prof. [Ninyu Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ningyu) at Zhejiang University. Meanwhile, I am a part-time research assistant at [TIGER LAB](https://wenhuchen.github.io/lab.html), advised by [Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/).

## News 
- 06/2024 Released [II-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench), an image implication understanding benchmark for multimodal LLMs.
- 06/2024 Released [MMLU-Pro](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro), a more robust and challenging massive multi-task understanding dataset tailored to more rigorously benchmark large language models' capabilities.
- 02/2024: Our [MMMU Benchmark](https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io) was accepted to CVPR’24 as <font color="#df1a7d">Oral (0.78%)</font> !
- 01/2024  Release a new paper:"[A Comprehensive Study of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01286)" with a new benchmark [KnowEdit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zjunlp/KnowEdit)!
- 11/2023: Released [MMMU Benchmark](https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io) for massive perception, knowledge, and reasoning evaluation on large multimodal models.
- 09/2023: Started my Mathematics Exchange Program at University of Waterloo!
